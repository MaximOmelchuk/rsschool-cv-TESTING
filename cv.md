## About me  
Started learning JavaScript about 1 year ago through codewars.com  
just for work out the mind, but then codding got me hooked.  
Nowadays I have own private legal practice and work as a legal  
advisor with several IT-companies. In the near future I want to change  
my profession and become a frontend developer, because codding is really  
interesting for me and because it is impossible to be a lawyer in country  
without law.

      return x;
    } else {
     let last=list.slice(i)
                  .findIndex((y,j)=>y+1!==list[j+i+1]);
     if (last>=2) {
       let tmp=x+'-'+list[last+i];
       for (let e=i+1; e<=last+i; e++) {
         list[e]='';
       }
       return tmp;
     } else return x;
    }
  })
  return list.join(' ').trim().split(/ +/).join();
}
