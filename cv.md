## About me  
Started learning JavaScript about 1 year ago through codewars.com  
just for work out the mind, but then codding got me hooked.  
Nowadays I have own private legal practice and work as a legal  
advisor with several IT-companies. In the near future I want to change  
my profession and become a frontend developer, because codding is really  
interesting for me and because it is impossible to be a lawyer in country  
without law.
